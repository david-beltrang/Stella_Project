Stella is a JavaFX application that helps students learn programming through Pomodoro study sessions, monitor subject progress, and unlock visual growth rewards in an igloo. Developed in Java with H2 as a DB, it combines time tracking, gamification, and an engaging user interface to encourage discipline and perseverance.
