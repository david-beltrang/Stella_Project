<h1 align="center">❄️ Stella – Study Tracker and Visual Progress App</h1>

## 📌 Description
**Stella App**  

Stella is a JavaFX-based application designed to help students to manage their study sessions using the Pomodoro technique while tracking progress across different subjects.Instead of a generic progress bar, Stella uses motivational visual growth: a cute penguin whose igloo gradually builds and improves as you study, turning discipline into a rewarding and visually engaging experience.
Developed as part of the Fundamentals of Software Engineering course, Stella applies the full Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), integrating backend logic, an embedded relational database, and an interactive frontend interface.

## 🚀 Features
- **Pomodoro Timer:** Start, pause, and stop sessions tied to specific subjects.
- **Visual Growth Feedback:** Watch your penguin’s igloo evolve step-by-step as you complete study goals.
- **Statistics & Ranking:** View time spent per programming language, top studied language, and performance trends.
- **Study Goals & Achievements:** Set weekly goals and unlock special igloo upgrades or penguin accessories.

## 🛠 Technical Highlights
- **Java** for code and develop the app.  
- **Java FX** for an interactive and visually appealing GUI.  
- **H2 Embedded Database** for persistent local storage of study data.  
- **Git & GitHub** for version control and collaborative development.

## 🎯 Purpose
Beyond time tracking, Stella’s purpose is to motivate students to stay consistent in learn programming through visual rewards and gamified progression. It demonstrates the practical application of software engineering principles—from requirements gathering to deployment—while fostering creativity, user engagement, and disciplined study habits.
